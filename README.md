The distrbution of this data was slightly exponential

Since there were only 10 options to choose from last year's 25, I hypotesised that the distribution will be linear with a more shallow slope than last year. So with this model and the fact that GTO (game theory optimal) gave an expected value of  Based off intuition and last year's data we ended up choosing container 37, which turned out to be the 3rd best pick.
